# ðŸ§  NLP Foundations & Recommender System Evolution

This repository tracks my practical NLP learning journey using **spaCy** and **Hugging Face**, while evolving my **Final Year Project (Recommender System)** week by week.

---

## ðŸ“š WEEK 1: NLP Foundations
### ðŸŽ¯ Goal
Understand text structure and preprocessing using production-level tools (spaCy, regex, Hugging Face Datasets).

### âœ… Tasks
1. **Text Cleaning Pipeline**
   - Cleans noisy tweets/comments using regex + spaCy.
   - Handles URLs, emojis, mentions, punctuation, etc.
   - Outputs cleaned CSV ready for modeling.

2. **News Entity Analysis**
   - Extracts named entities, POS stats, and subjectâ€“verbâ€“object structures.
   - Visualizes organization/person/location counts in news headlines.

## ðŸ§± Long-Term Project: NLP-Enhanced Recommender System
Iâ€™m integrating each weekâ€™s NLP concept into my recommender system.

| Phase | Focus | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Text Cleaning & Preprocessing | Clean product descriptions/reviews using custom pipeline |
| 2 | Text Representation & Embeddings | Use TF-IDF, Word2Vec, or BERT embeddings for item similarity |
| 3 | Modeling & Evaluation | Implement content-based and hybrid recommender logic |
| 4 | Deployment | Build an API or Streamlit UI for real-time recommendations |

## ðŸ§° Tech Stack
- **spaCy**
- **Hugging Face Datasets**
- **Regex**
- **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)**
